wanted to ensure that a part of my personality was reflected in the project, which is why I chose purple as the main color.

For the Hero section, I aimed to seamlessly blend with the purple theme while also captivating attention, hence the incorporation of a video background.

While crafting my About Me section, I noticed that I had only included a brief paragraph about myself. To engage viewers further, I decided to incorporate animated elements into the image to capture their attention.

In the Project section, I showcased the various projects I've undertaken. To enhance user experience, I implemented an animation that allows the projects to rotate when hovered over.

Finally, in the Contact section, I provided details on how people can get in touch with me. To make this section stand out, I opted for a different color that would pop on the page.
